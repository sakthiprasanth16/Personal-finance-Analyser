# Project overview

Goal: build an intelligent finance assistant that can read any bank, credit card, or UPI PDF statement and convert it into clear spending insights and actionable recommendations.  
The project combines PDF parsing, a 3-layer categorization system, interactive analytics, and Google Gemini AI to provide personalized financial guidance and professional reports.

# Key features

## What this app does

* **PDF parsing**
  * Extracts financial transactions from any bank / credit card / UPI statement PDF.
  * Supports wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, and GPay, as long as the PDF contains text-based transactions.

* **AI categorization**
  * Uses Google Gemini AI plus rules to automatically categorize expenses into Essentials vs Discretionary and detailed categories.

* **Spending analysis**
  * Generates visual charts for category-wise spending, top categories, and time-based patterns.
  * Detects potential wasteful spending such as subscriptions, frequent small purchases, and possible duplicates.

* **Personalized advice**
  * Produces AI-powered financial recommendations based on the user’s transaction history and spending behavior.

* **Report generation**
  * Builds downloadable PDF reports including summaries, charts, category breakdown, and recommendations.

## 3-layer smart categorizer

* **Layer 1 – Merchant database**
  * Maps known merchants (e.g., grocery, OTT, food delivery, transport) to predefined categories for fast and accurate tagging.

* **Layer 2 – Pattern engine (regex)**
  * Uses regex rules over transaction descriptions to detect patterns like groceries, fuel, shopping, and services.

* **Layer 3 – AI fallback (Gemini)**
  * For unknown or ambiguous merchants, delegates final categorization to Google Gemini AI.

---

## Wasteful spending detection

* Identifies recurring subscriptions and memberships using periodic patterns.
* Flags frequent low-value purchases that add up over time.
* Highlights potential duplicate transactions based on repeated date/amount/description.
* Surfaces high-value discretionary expenses for user review.

---

# Technology stack

* **Streamlit** – Web interface and user interaction.
* **Google Gemini AI** – Transaction extraction assistance, categorization fallback, and personalized recommendations.
* **pdfplumber** – PDF text extraction and transaction parsing.
* **Pandas / NumPy** – Data cleaning, aggregation, and numerical calculations.
* **Plotly / Matplotlib** – Interactive and static visualizations for spending analysis.
* **ReportLab** – Generation of professional PDF reports.
* **Pillow / openpyxl** – Image handling and Excel-compatible exports when needed.

# How it works

## Upload PDF

User uploads any bank, credit card, or UPI statement PDF via the Streamlit interface.

## Extract transactions

* pdfplumber reads the PDF and extracts tabular or line-based transaction data.
* Custom parsing logic normalizes dates, descriptions, and amounts.

## Categorize & tag

The 3-layer categorizer assigns merchant-level and category labels, plus Essential vs Discretionary tags.

## Analyze spending

The app computes totals per category, time-based trends, and wasteful-spending indicators, then visualizes them.

## Generate AI advice

Gemini uses the aggregated view to propose budgets, reduction opportunities, and savings estimates.

## Export & report

Users can download a CSV of all transactions and a neatly formatted PDF report with charts and recommendations.

---

# Usage instructions

## 1. Start the app (local)

From the project root:

streamlit run app.py

This usually opens the app at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

Or try the hosted demo directly:  
https://huggingface.co/spaces/prasanthr0416/Ai_Finance_Analyser

---

## 2. Enter Gemini API key

On first run, the app will ask for your Google Gemini API key in a text input or sidebar field.

Alternatively, set an environment variable before running:

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" # macOS / Linux
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here" # Windows (PowerShell)

The app reads this key to call the Gemini API for categorization and advice.

---

## 3. Upload a statement PDF

* Click the “Choose a PDF file” button.
* Select your bank / card / UPI statement PDF (e.g., Paytm, PhonePe, GPay statement).
* Wait for parsing and extraction to complete; progress/spinner will be shown.

---

## 4. Explore tabs

### Transactions

* View the cleaned transaction table.
* See automatically assigned category and Essential / Discretionary tags.
* Check flags for subscriptions, duplicates, and high-value discretionary items.

### Analytics

* Category-wise spending pie chart.
* Bar chart of top spending categories.
* Time-based plots (daily / hourly trends) to see when spending spikes.

### AI Recommendations

* Generated budget suggestions per major category.
* Concrete tips to reduce wasteful spending.
* Estimated potential savings if suggestions are followed.

### Download report

* Button to export CSV transaction data.
* Button to generate and download a PDF report with summary, charts, and AI insights.

# Deployment

## Streamlit Community Cloud

* Push the project to a public GitHub repository.
* Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and connect your repo.
* Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the app’s Secrets configuration.
* Deploy; Streamlit will build from `requirements.txt` and run `app.py`.

## Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit)

* Create a new Space and select **Streamlit** as the SDK.
* Upload `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and any assets.
* In **Settings → Secrets**, add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your key.
* The Space will build and give you a public URL, for example:  
  `https://huggingface.co/spaces/prasanthr0416/Ai_Finance_Analyser`
